# Sublime Snippets for Frappe/ERPNext

<p style="justify-content: center;">Whenever you are writing the code youre likely to need certain short fragments of code again and again. 
Sublime snippets are created to help lazy people (including me) to make things more easy ;)
This repository includes code snippets which are very useful if you are using Frappe/ERPNext development.</p>

<b>How to Use</b>
<p style="justify-content: center;">Clone the repository <a href="https://github.com/abs001/SSF">Sublime Snippets For Frappe/ERPNext</a> into your sublime snippets path <br><i>example :/home/user_name/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User</i> <br>and have a happy coding.
Example code to write below function <br>
<code>
	frappe.get_value(doctype_name, name, filed_name)
</code>

you only need to type <i>frappegetvalue</i> and when the suggested code appear and when you select this specific code all the syntax came in to the game.

The next most important thing is that you just need to press tab key to switch between variables in snippet, for example lets say if you added above function using snippet and for above function if you want to change the variable <code>doctype_name</code> then just you need to hit tab button and selection moves to that variable. Again when you press the tab the selection goes to the next variable.
